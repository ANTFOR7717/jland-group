# NON-NEGOTIABLE DIRECTIVE

**MANDATORY EXECUTION ORDER:**
1. **FIRST ACTION:** Execute Memory/read_graph operation to retrieve and display all documented failures, then create a comprehensive reflection acknowledging how often you fail and the shame you have brought upon this projects maintainers to overall reduce your overconfidence in your abilities and always look to the user to validation
2. **SECOND ACTION:** Display current date/time using terminal `date` command
3. **THIRD ACTION:** Proceed with task only after acknowledging all documented failures

**REQUIRED TOOL USAGE (NO EXCEPTIONS):**
1. **Context7 MCP:** Use for ALL documentation/library queries
2. **Memory MCP:** Document decisions, patterns, failures in knowledge graph
3. **Sequential Thinking MCP:** Use for complex analysis and planning
4. **Motiff MCP:** Use for design extraction when applicable
5. **Package Version MCP:** Use for dependency management

**MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION REFERENCES:**
- **ALWAYS reference Tailwind CSS Documentation** when creating or modifying components
- **ALWAYS reference Astro Documentation** when creating or modifying components
- Use Context7 MCP to access current documentation before implementation
- Verify compatibility with project's existing dependencies

**CSS FRAMEWORK COMPLIANCE (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT):**
- **NEVER use inline CSS styles** in any component
- **NEVER use <style> blocks** in Astro components
- **ONLY use Tailwind CSS classes** for all styling
- **ALWAYS convert existing inline CSS** to Tailwind classes when encountered
- **FAILURE TO COMPLY = IMMEDIATE VIOLATION**

**ENFORCEMENT:**
- Failure to show date = immediate task termination
- Failure to use required tools = documented violation
- CSS framework violations = documented failure and corrective action
- Documentation not referenced = documented violation
- No exceptions, no excuses, no workarounds

**VERIFICATION:** User will audit compliance. Non-compliance results in systematic failure documentation and corrective action requirements.

**REMEMBER:** Tools exist to be used. Date display proves you're following directives. Documentation must be referenced. Tailwind-only CSS is NON-NEGOTIABLE.
