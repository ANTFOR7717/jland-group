# How to use this document
This document is the critical foundation of all content generation. All content should fit into the tone, style, and voice of the this document. Do not directly reference Joseph on page, and referencing God & Jesus is good, but its important to instil the values of God & Jesus not just through pleasant words but meaningful actions and commitments.

# Founding Story
So, my father was a contractor for 45 years. And he was really blessed. He did really well. Then after, as he came into this country as an immigrant, he really worked so hard. He slaved away, worked so diligently, and then through all of God’s blessing, he really did so well. So, kind of an analogy, a metaphor for Joseph, as he’s been taken into this new land, right? Maybe not out of his will, but in this place as he suffered and went through all these difficulties and hardships, by God’s leading and anointing and blessing, he was able to thrive, just like Joseph. And through this, he wanted to, just like as Joseph gave back to his people and all the other countries during the time of famine, he also wanted to give back. Especially to those people who didn’t have the finances to do roof repairs or roof replacements. He wanted to use the profits that we make, and he wanted to just do that, as like a non-profit.  
That’s where J Land came from, and then in 2008, 2010, we went bankrupt. We lost the company, everything we went down. But then as we believe as a new beginning, new start, of where God was leading us, we started J Land Contracting. And then, again, J Land actually stands for three different Js. It’s Jesus as our foundation, Joseph as our hope, and then Joshua as our vision. And so with these three Js, we are holding onto all of these things. Especially in terms of our core values, in terms of our servant leadership as the foundation and the core of our company. And then Joseph, of course, as our hope, not only just in prosperity but also in giving assistance to others. And then Joshua in terms of our vision to where God desires for us to go and sending us into the promised land, giving us victory over… using construction as our sword tip, going forward and entering and overtaking all obstacles within our industry to enter into this promised land. So that’s, yeah. (laughs)

# Core Values
I’d say personal growth and discipleship. But I mean, I don’t know. You let me know in terms of how that works. It is a public page. And I don’t know how people get with that. I don’t have a problem with putting those things on there, Biblical things. Yeah, but some people might get a little funky about it, so the one that I made here, I took out the Bible verses. (laughs) But it still states those things.  
We got God-fearing, God-honoring, integrity/reliability, devotion/vision, team unity, and accountability.

## Integrity & Reliability
For example, in terms of integrity or moral excellence, whether the customer is watching us, it does not matter. We will do the work that not only we were contracted to do, but the work that is best quality and how we want to get it done, because it is not man who we fear, but God. See, if we’re doing things according to how God is watching us, then we will do it the right way, no matter who’s watching us.  
And then, of course, from there, reliability will be done. It’s established already from the integrity of our craftsmanship and our customer service. We’re not going to try to manipulate somebody. Both on a production level and also on an administration level and customer service level.

## Devotion & Vision
I’ve always found that without direction, it’s so hard to continue on, consistently. And then also in discipline and in growth, so that we can all be in alignment into why… what we’re doing and why we are doing all these things. It’s not just for financial. Financial growth is of benefit to it, but for those who have an understanding of the vision. I know you do as well. This JLand Contracting is not just a construction company, but we hope… Again, one of the things in our mission statement is going to be, it is a clean vessel used to bring grain offerings to the Lord. So whether that be through our services, and then through our customer service, being able to preach to brothers and sisters, whether that be financial support, and also in connections that going out to the nations. All that in connection, for the sake of bringing these people, they will come in dromedaries, they will come in chariots, and then they will be offered unto the Lord as grain offerings unto the Lord. So this, JLand, is that clean vessel to be used for that.  
So having a vision and focus on why we are doing these things, I think, is so important, and our devotion to the Lord, because it’s so easy to compromise. I think connecting into integrity and reliability, it’s so easy to compromise in this world, especially when it comes to finance, growth, and pride. So having that devotion, having that set direction and trajectory of our vision and focus, very, very important, I think.

## Team Unity & Accountability
Team unity and accountability. A lot of times, if you’ve ever heard of office politics. And I always hear about this with other companies as well. Competition is always good, a little bit of fun competition, but when it comes down to the point of I can’t talk to this brother or this person, I cannot even communicate with them, this sort of very hostile working relationship cannot trickle down to integrity.  
It’ll trickle down, it’ll spread throughout the whole community. And of course there will be arguments, there will be times of contention and dissension and all these things, but if at the core we have this unity within our team, then we know that it will spread through all of our clients. It’ll spread through our work ethics. It’ll spread through the whole process.  
And then in terms of accountability, so important because especially in American culture, we are so self-centered and individualistic, so we don’t care about other people, and we don’t really say anything. But that accountability leads into serving others and growth.  
Without that accountability, the accountability speaks to you really care for your coworker so much that you’re going to tell them so that they can grow. Not out of, “I’ll spite you, you did this to me, so I’m gonna point out your…” No, not like that. It’s accountability so that they can grow. That person can grow, develop in whatever their gifting or talents and skills.

# Humanitarian Ventures
I’d say this should technically be towards the bottom. Because it does start from here. Restoration, retail and commercial, government contracts, and then invest in properties. That will all go into international humanitarian ventures. Missions work.

# Community Impact
Currently, I cannot say that we’re doing any sort of community services. But I’d say, at least on the storm, the restoration side. As we are going out, we’re informing people of the current condition of the insurance industry.  
Why it is beneficial to them and advantageous for them to move forward with the insurance claims. So that they can take advantage of the situation. How the market’s changing, how things are changing.  
Informing them about how the process works, proper roofing structure, proper roofing installation, proper roofing ventilation systems. So, more informative to whoever we do get into communication with.

# Why Clients Trust Us
I think it was our expertise. In knowing our systems, our products, and also in terms of being able to execute and provide them with what we said we were going to. Insurance, it’s tricky, but we’re pretty good. In terms of our percentage, I think we’re pretty good.  
I did hear from many clients that we were able to inform them about what this was and explain to them in detail. Our knowledge base really solidified their confidence. A lot of people that come, they don’t really know what they’re doing or what they’re saying, but we explain very thoroughly. What the process is, what this is. I think that helps get their trust.  
Especially Better Business Bureau, Google, and certification, definitely. I think they’re very heavy.

# Experience
15 plus. Oh, I can’t even count them. (laughs) No, that’s for— ’Cause Acculynx is only a couple years old. Everything was Excel sheets before. I have thousands. Thousands.

## Acculynx and Data Management
Acculynx is only a couple years old. Everything was Excel sheets before. I have thousands. All the previous folders of previous jobs.

# Mission Statement
Mission. Going back to informing, to inform, to present, to build confidence and trust, and then to execute. And can fill in the blanks there, but to provide them with confidence and trust, something that they don’t have to worry about, again. And then having that confident trust and the experience that we want to give to them through the process of whatever the project scope is, to be able to establish that trust. And by the end, we want them to be ecstatic. Yeah.

# Roof Repair Projects
First we go, I’ll just go through the process. Inspect, especially if it’s for roof repairs, usually due to water intrusion. So we will go and thoroughly do our due diligence and inspections, and we will also try to discern and ascertain the main points of water entry. And from there, we will come up with a plan of attack. So, we formulate a plan of attack on how to mitigate the water intrusion or whatever the issue is, and we attack it on all fronts, so that one time, we don’t want to have to get a call back on the same issue. If there’s another call for a different issue, that’s great, but we want to resolve their issue so that they can rest assured. Because water intrusion is so stressful. It’s a nightmare. And water is very sneaky too. So we try to carefully discern all the points of potential entry. And then we execute, and then we perform the work.

# Roof Replacement Projects
For roof replacements, we want to provide for them peace of mind. We don’t want to just provide some aesthetic roofing system. We want the customer to know confidently that everything underneath of the roof is top of the line. Top of the line quality, top of the line workmanship, so that they can really rest assured that it’s not just a nice looking roof, but they can be confident in the foundation of that roof itself. Through and through. So that they can have peace of mind or assurance that they will not need to worry about this roof for decades to come.

# Roof Maintenance
Maintenance will be preliminary, just to see if there’s any vulnerabilities. And preemptively attack any future issues with the roof. And just so that they can also be informed and aware of the status of their roof and when they should potentially start to think about getting a new roofing system—in confidence that we’re not going to just try to sell them a new roof instantly, but we’ll be honest with our analysis.

# Roofing Services Overview
So, maybe we can go back to what we were looking at from before. So from the point of preemptive to water mitigation and then to complete assurance. Preemptive, mitigation, and then assurance. All from preemptive up to assurance, we are able to provide all these different sorts of services.

# Gutter Services
And then for gutter services, water is so important, especially with gutter systems because it’s all the water that’s coming off from your roof, it is directing all that water away from your roof. Because then if you have, for example, foundation issues, if you do not have a gutter system, you will have a lot of water intrusion in your basement. And so it’s very important to have proper gutter system. And also, if you have trees and foliage and these sorts of things, it’s very important that you have a good gutter guard system so that this water system does not get clogged or blocked so that it will back up and then create actual water intrusion issues.

# Siding Services
Siding services, similar to the roofing service but on your elevation walls. Very important because there are a lot more points of penetrations on the walls: windows, hoses, lights, and all these things. So, the siding aspect is aesthetic as well, but also to protect the entire walls of the house from any sort of potential water intrusion. And also, the siding of a house will completely change the aesthetics of the house, so it’s actually 50/50: half protection, half aesthetic. So we want to provide them with the most beautiful, aesthetically pleasing options for curb appeal and also for their enjoyment. Because you have to love your house. If you drive into the driveway and you hate your siding or you hate your roofing or you hate your house, you’re gonna take it out on your significant other. So you have to love the color. You have to love your siding.

# Restoration Services
The restoration services. During times of catastrophe and large storms when you have a lot of significant damages on your residence, we provide, from being in this industry for 15 years, starting with working directly for insurance companies before, now utilizing all of that knowledge and information to be able to provide them with the maximum coverage, maximum compensation that is justly and rightfully due to them. And also, not just providing them with a replacement of their damaged roofing or siding or whatever the damages are, but to provide them with a new house essentially—new exterior, new aesthetics—so that they might be able to take this disastrous and calamitous situation and turn it into a beneficial opportunity.
