  - title: "Ventilation Systems"
    description: "Proper attic ventilation is crucial for maintaining optimal roof performance. Without adequate airflow, heat and moisture can build up, leading to premature shingle deterioration and ice dam formation.\n\nOur devoted installations include strategic soffit vents, ridge vents, and gable vents to ensure balanced air circulation, preventing condensation and extending your roof's lifespan by up to 30+ years."

  - title: "Water Shedding Physics"
    description: "The physics of water flow across roofing surfaces is fundamental to system integrity. Water must be directed away from vulnerable areas through proper slope, flashing, and drainage systems.\n\nOur reliable installations incorporate devoted water shedding with proper pitch calculations and seamless valley flashing to prevent water intrusion, backed by our comprehensive warranty."

  - title: "Ice & Water Shield Protection"
    description: "Ice and water shields are critical barriers against moisture infiltration, especially in Maryland's freeze-thaw cycles. These self-adhering membranes prevent water backup during winter conditions.\n\nWe install premium ice and water shields in all critical areas, including eaves, valleys, and penetrations, ensuring complete protection against water damage with integrity for your home's structure."

  - title: "Ridge Cap Engineering"
    description: "The ridge cap serves as the roof's final line of defense against wind-driven rain and provides essential ventilation. Properly installed ridge caps prevent water infiltration at the roof's peak.\n\nOur ridge cap installations use continuous cement and high-quality ridge shingles, ensuring weather-tight seals and optimal attic ventilation for maximum performance and longevity through team unity."
