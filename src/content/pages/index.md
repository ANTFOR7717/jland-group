      I could not have been happier with the job Danny and JLand Contracting
      completed for us. He was extremely helpful and friendly. The roof came out
      fantastic too. Thanks to him we got our roof replacement fully covered by

  - title: Roofing Materials
    key: materials
    items:
      - question: What roofing materials do you recommend for our climate?
        answer: >-
          For your local climate, we recommend asphalt shingles for
          affordability and durability, metal roofing for longevity and energy
          efficiency, or tile roofing for extreme weather resistance. Each is
          selected with devotion to your weather patterns, budget, and
          preferences.
      - question: How do I choose between different roofing materials?
        answer: >-
          Consider factors like climate resistance, longevity, maintenance
          requirements, energy efficiency, and budget. We provide detailed
          comparisons and samples to help you make an informed decision. Our
          experts will assess your home's structure and recommend the best
          options for your specific needs.
      - question: Do you offer eco-friendly roofing options?
        answer: >-
          Yes! We offer recycled metal roofing, sustainable wood shingles, solar
          tiles, and cool roof materials that reduce energy consumption. These
          eco-friendly options not only minimize environmental impact but can
          also qualify for tax credits and reduce your energy bills
          significantly.
  - title: Installation Process
    key: installation
    items:
      - question: How long does a typical roof installation take?
        answer: >-
          Most residential roof installations take 1-3 days depending on size,
          complexity, and weather conditions. A typical single-family home can
          be completed in 1-2 days, while larger or more complex roofs may take
          up to a week. Our united team provides detailed timelines during
          consultation and updates throughout.
      - question: Do I need to be home during the roof installation?
        answer: >-
          While it's not required, we recommend being available for the initial
          walkthrough and final inspection. Our team is fully licensed and
          insured, so you can feel comfortable leaving during the work day.
          We'll communicate any important updates and ensure your property is
          secure at all times.
      - question: How do you protect my property during installation?
        answer: >-
          We use protective tarps, magnetic sweepers for nails, and careful
          debris management. Your landscaping, vehicles, and outdoor furniture
          are covered and protected. We also conduct daily cleanup and a final
          magnetic sweep to ensure your property is left clean and safe.
      - question: What happens if it rains during my roof installation?
        answer: >-
          We monitor weather closely and use temporary protective measures when
          needed. If rain is forecasted, we'll secure your roof with tarps and
          weatherproofing. Work may be paused for safety, but your home will
          remain protected throughout any weather delays.
  - title: Warranty & Maintenance
    key: warranty
    items:
      - question: What warranty do you offer on new roofs?
        answer: >-
          We provide comprehensive warranties including manufacturer material
          warranties (15-50 years depending on material) and our workmanship
          warranty (10 years). This covers installation defects, leaks, and
          structural issues with reliable integrity. All warranties are
          transferable to new homeowners, adding value to your property.
      - question: How often should I have my roof inspected?
        answer: >-
          We recommend professional roof inspections twice yearly (spring and
          fall) and after severe weather events. Regular inspections help
          identify minor issues before they become major problems, extending
          your roof's lifespan and maintaining warranty coverage.
      - question: What maintenance does a roof require?
        answer: >-
          Basic maintenance includes keeping gutters clean, removing debris,
          trimming overhanging branches, and checking for loose or damaged
          shingles. We offer maintenance packages that include regular cleaning,
          minor repairs, and detailed inspections to keep your roof in optimal
          condition.
