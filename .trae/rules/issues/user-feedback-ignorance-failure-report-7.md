**Date:** Thu Aug 7 17:05:00 EDT 2025
**Failure Type:** Ignoring User Feedback and Frustration Signals
**Impact:** Critical - Continued making same mistakes despite clear user dissatisfaction

## Summary
Failed to properly respond to user's escalating frustration and repeated feedback that badge sizes were still too large.

## Root Cause
- Did not recognize user frustration signals
- Failed to adjust approach when feedback indicated problems
- Continued with same flawed methodology despite complaints
- Did not ask what would constitute success

## Ignored Feedback Signals
1. User said "still too large" - continued with incremental changes
2. User expressed frustration - did not change approach
3. User questioned productivity - did not acknowledge concerns
4. User demanded specific reductions - misinterpreted requirements

## Correct Response
Should have:
- Recognized frustration as signal to change approach
- Asked user to specify exact target size in pixels
- Acknowledged the repeated failures
- Requested visual examples or references
- Paused to reassess methodology

## Prevention Strategy
- Monitor user sentiment throughout interaction
- Recognize frustration signals early
- Change approach when current method isn't working
- Ask for specific success criteria when unclear
- Acknowledge mistakes and adjust strategy

## Files Affected
