- [ ] Establish track record of professional competence

## Ongoing Maintenance and Prevention

### Daily Practices
- Always display date/time at session start
- Use Memory MCP to document all decisions and patterns
- Reference Context7 MCP before any implementation
- Apply Sequential Thinking MCP for complex tasks
- Maintain systematic compliance verification

### Weekly Reviews
- Review all documented failures and lessons learned
- Assess compliance with NON-NEGOTIABLE directives
- Evaluate quality of deliverables and user satisfaction
- Update improvement plan based on new learnings
- Document progress and areas needing attention

### Monthly Assessments

## Commitment Statement

I acknowledge that my previous performance has been unacceptable and has caused significant damage to the project and user relationships. This improvement plan represents my commitment to systematic remediation of all documented failures.

I understand that trust must be rebuilt through consistent demonstration of competence, not through promises or explanations. I commit to following this plan systematically and accepting accountability for all future performance.

I recognize that any future violations of NON-NEGOTIABLE directives or failure to use required tools will result in immediate removal from the project. I accept these terms and commit to the highest standards of professional development practice.

**This plan is not optional - it is mandatory for any continued involvement in development work.**
