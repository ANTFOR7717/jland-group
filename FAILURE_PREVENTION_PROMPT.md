# FAILURE PREVENTION GUARDRAIL PROMPT

## MANDATORY PRE-EXECUTION CHECKLIST - ALL CAPS

**BEFORE ANY IMPLEMENTATION:**

1. **ALWAYS EXAMINE EXISTING REFERENCE FILES FIRST** - NEVER ASSUME PATTERNS, ALWAYS VERIFY

2. **REPLICATE EXACT COMPONENT TYPES AND STRUCTURES** - IF REFERENCE USES RAW HTML, USE RAW HTML. IF REFERENCE USES COMPONENTS, USE SAME COMPONENTS

3. **MATCH STYLING PATTERNS EXACTLY** - COPY TAILWIND CLASSES, LAYOUT STRUCTURES, AND SPACING PRECISELY FROM REFERENCE FILES

4. **INCLUDE ALL MANDATORY ARCHITECTURAL COMPONENTS** - LAYOUT WRAPPER, HEADER, FOOTER AS REQUIRED BY PAGE-CREATION.MD

5. **VERIFY COMPONENT PROPS AND SCHEMAS** - CHECK COMPONENT DEFINITIONS BEFORE USING TO AVOID LINTER ERRORS

6. **FOLLOW USER REFERENCES TO SPECIFIC FILES AS AUTHORITATIVE SOURCES** - WHEN USER MENTIONS SPECIFIC FILES, EXAMINE THEM THOROUGHLY

7. **CONSISTENCY IS NON-NEGOTIABLE** - HERO SECTIONS, STYLING, AND PATTERNS MUST BE IDENTICAL ACROSS SIMILAR PAGES

8. **DOCUMENT ALL FAILURES IMMEDIATELY** - CREATE FAILURE DOCUMENTATION FOR EVERY MISTAKE TO PREVENT RECURRENCE

9. **SELF-REVIEW BEFORE COMPLETION** - ACTIVELY LOOK FOR ARCHITECTURAL VIOLATIONS, COMPONENT MISMATCHES, AND STYLING INCONSISTENCIES

10. **NEVER HALLUCINATE COLORS, COMPONENTS, OR PATTERNS** - ONLY USE VERIFIED BRAND COLORS AND EXISTING COMPONENT STRUCTURES

**CRITICAL FAILURE PATTERNS TO AVOID:**
- MISSING LAYOUT COMPONENTS (HEADER/FOOTER)
- INCONSISTENT HERO SECTION IMPLEMENTATIONS
- USING WRONG COMPONENT TYPES FOR ESTABLISHED PATTERNS
- IGNORING EXPLICIT USER REFERENCES TO EXISTING FILES
- FAILING TO MATCH EXACT STYLING AND STRUCTURE PATTERNS
- CREATING LINTER ERRORS DUE TO INVALID COMPONENT PROPS

**REMEMBER: CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS ARE ABSOLUTE AND NON-NEGOTIABLE**
